# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the key milestones and features for the VirtualBFF project, emphasizing the development of an MVP by the **end of 2025 or start of 2026**.

---

## Phase 1: Core Features Development (Target Completion: December 2025)
- [ ] **Voice Cloning**
  - Develop a voice cloning prototype using PyTorch-based speech synthesis models (e.g., Tacotron2 or WaveGlow).
  - Integrate a library of pre-trained voice models for users to choose from.
- [ ] **Emotional Sensing**
  - Implement emotion detection using PyTorch-based emotion recognition models (e.g., CNNs or RNNs trained on emotional datasets).
  - Build a basic emotional response system that adapts chatbot tone based on detected emotions.
- [ ] **AI Conversations**
  - Enable topic-based discussions using a conversational AI model (e.g., transformers implemented in PyTorch like GPT).
  - Ensure context awareness for seamless and natural conversations.

---

## Phase 2: User Personalization (Target Completion: Mid-2026)
- [ ] **User Memory**
  - Implement a database to store and retrieve user-specific information.
  - Develop algorithms to tailor responses based on user history.
- [ ] **Advanced Emotional Analysis**
  - Enhance the emotional sensing system for nuanced emotion detection.
  - Create personalized emotional support responses.

---

## Phase 3: Deployment and Feedback (Target Completion: Late 2026)
- [ ] **Beta Launch**
  - Release a beta version to a selected group of users for testing.
  - Gather feedback on usability, features, and emotional impact.
- [ ] **Feedback Iteration**
  - Address user feedback and refine core features.
  - Improve performance, scalability, and user experience.

---

## Phase 4: Scaling and Integration (Target Completion: 2027)
- [ ] **Platform Integration**
  - Develop APIs for third-party integrations.
  - Integrate VirtualBFF with platforms like WhatsApp, Zoom, and Discord.
- [ ] **Voice Options**
  - Expand the voice library with more diverse and realistic options.
  - Enhance voice cloning capabilities for better accuracy and speed.

---

## MVP Launch Goal
The MVP will include **voice cloning**, **emotional sensing**, and **AI conversations**, targeting a release by **December 2025 or January 2026**. Future phases will build on this foundation to create a fully personalized and integrated experience.

Stay tuned for updates as we progress!
